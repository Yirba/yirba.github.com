				<p>Welcome to this English language guide to the 07th Expansion character popularity poll. This guide was created to aid English speakers to vote in the poll. If you have any queries about this guide or the poll, feel free to email me (Yirba): &lt;yirba3 AT gmail DOT com&gt;</p>
				
				<h2>About the poll</h2>
				
				<p>07th Expansion regularly run polls on their website where fans can vote for their favourite characters from a particular game. At the end of the poll, a ranking of the characters is published.</p>
				
				<p>This time, things are a bit different. Firstly, there are four polls this time, one for each of four games. (I'm guessing these games are <i>Higurashi</i>, <i>Umineko</i>, <i>Higanbana</i> and <i>Rose Guns Days</i>.) Secondly, the polls are integrated with <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, so be sure to <a href="http://support.twitter.com/groups/31-twitter-basics/topics/104-welcome-to-twitter-support/articles/100990-how-to-sign-up-on-twitter" target="_blank">create an account</a> there before you start.</p>
