<p class="important">Important: The Fuwanovel plan has changed. It will no longer provide game downloads (except for freeware). Due to this change, I now fully support the project, and wish it huge success. Therefore, although my views on piracy still stand, the majority of the following can be ignored. <a href="http://visualnovelaer.wordpress.com/2012/01/28/fuwanovel-will-have-no-game-downloads/">More info at Visual Novel Aer.</a></p>

<h1>Yirba&apos;s view on Fuwanovel</h1>
<p class="important">Important: To those reading this and are unaware of the situation, I urge you to read <a href="http://forums.fuwanovel.com/index.php?/topic/10-about-fuwanovel-for-fan-translators/" title="Fuwanovel">Aaeru's introductory post about Fuwanovel</a> first.</p>

<p class="less-important"><abbr title="Too Long; Didn't Read">TL;DR</abbr>: Fuwanovel is a website which aims to provide visual novels for free <b>without the original creator's</b> permission. Although I agree with certain aspects of Fuwanovel's mission, I cannot support the unauthorised distribution of visual novels.</p>

<p>I have been a huge fan of visual novels for a few years now. Starting with commercial releases, I soon began to read using fan translations, and with my participation in the <a href="http://ronove.blogspot.com/" title="Higanbana translation project"><i>Higanbana no Saku Yoru ni</i> fan translation project</a>, I consider myself to be part of the visual novel translation community.</p>

<p>For a long time, I have wished that visual novels could have a greater prominence in the West. Visual novels are an exciting medium, and I would love to see more people play them. Also, the amount of translated visual novels <b>needs to increase</b>! A lot of visual novel fans feel frustrated due to the lack of translation even for some of the most popular and highly-regarded visual novels.</p>

<h2>So, where does Fuwanovel come into this?</h2>

<p>I've known Aaeru for some time now. Although we've never had much of a conversation, I do regularly read <a href="http://visualnovelaer.wordpress.com/" title="Visual Novel Aer">her blog</a>, and from our few short chats, she comes off as a very friendly person. With regards to visual novels, her heart is certainly in the right place.</p>

<p>However, her recent announcement of Fuwanovel is definitely not something I can agree with. What is Fuwanovel? It's a website where you can download pre-patched visual novels for free, but without the original creator's permission.</p>

<p>Anyone who knows me will know that <b>I hate piracy</b>. I hate the notion of not giving something back to the original creators. Visual novels are typically developed by small teams, and many of these teams aren't exactly rich, either. Many studios can only afford to rent a small apartment to do their work in. Heck, there was even one instance of a studio having to work <b>in a kitchen</b>! Many developers are just struggling to survive… and you want to steal from them?!</p>

<p>Okay, okay, some people will say that piracy is not so bad. Some people will say that it does no harm at all. Some people will say that piracy is the future and should be legalised. I don't feel that way. If I have spent several months making a game, and I sell my game for money, I have every right to expect people to pay for it.</p>

<p>Leaving piracy aside for the moment, let's take a look at Fuwanovel's objectives…</p>

<p><span class="important">"Make high quality English translated visual novels more accessible for everyone":</span> I can completely agree with this. It is difficult for the average person to set up a fan-translated visual novel. People wouldn't want to bother moving files around, unpacking archives, etc. They just want to get straight to the game.</p>

<p><span class="important">"Make fan translation easier to get into":</span> I also agree with this. Simply speaking, we need more fan translators. There simply aren't enough people working on these games. I'm in full support of trying to get more people involved.</p>

<p><span class="important">"Promote a culture of tolerance and open discussion":</span> This too. We need to bring the community closer and have proper discussions where everyone can bring their views to the table.</p>

<p>As you can see, I'm not inherently opposed to everything Fuwanovel is trying to do. I fully support these objectives. However, the actual implementation is questionable.</p>

<h2>Why does it have to involve piracy?!</h2>

<p>Fuwanovel labels itself as "not a pirate site". This is just for marketing purposes. No question about it, <b>downloading from Fuwanovel <i>is</i> piracy!</b> Okay, so let's take a look at the reasons for piracy:</p>

<p><span class="important">"Fan translation is piracy already":</span> Fan translation patches contain a translated version of the original script, which is therefore infringing copyright. While this may be so, I don't agree that because we're already engaging in piracy, that it's okay to pirate any further. Original creators are already against fan translation. We should be convincing them to embrace the fan translation scene. After all, they do make money from people who import the games and use them with translation patches. <b>We should be working with original creators, not making enemies with them.</b> If we love their work so much, why are we going against their wishes?</p>

<p><span class="important">"People aren't going to pay for a legitimate copy":</span> Yes, importing games is expensive. No doubt about that. The exchange rate doesn't work in our favour, which is why Japanese games are so expensive. <b>So let's <i>do</i> something about that!</b> Rather than just put up with these expensive prices, let's work with original creators to bring those prices down for people in the West. I'm sure developers would rather have <i>some</i> money than <i>no</i> money. Bring downloadable versions to the West with lower prices!</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>I've waffled on quite a bit now about why Fuwanovel is doing things wrong. So, how do we do it correctly? I propose the following:</p>

<p>Fuwanovel is a <b>good idea</b> in concept. We want a place where people can download all their favourite visual novels with minimum hassle. We want a place where fan translators can share their work with a large audience.</p>

<p><b>But we won't pirate. No piracy. Whatsoever.</b></p> We talk to the visual novel developers. We say, "Hi, we really love your work, and we'd love to bring your visual novel to people around the world. We will translate your game <b>for free</b>. A downloadable version of the game pre-patched with our translation will be available for purchase at our website. <b>And we will send all the money earned straight back to you.</b>"</p>

<p>That's right. We'll do exactly what Fuwanovel is trying to do now, but with the difference that we will <b>charge for these games, but with all the money going back to the developer</b>.</p>

<p><b>This solves another of Fuwanovel's problems:</b> Torrents and RARs are too complicated for the average person. Indeed, Aaeru has said as much in her posts about Fuwanovel. <b>So why is Fuwanovel using them?</b> Under the current proposals, a user would have to download a torrent of a RAR. Isn't that defeating the whole point of accessibility?</p>

<p>If we did this properly, we could have the developer's permission to re-package the game with English translation intact <b>as an EXE file and host them on-site as a direct download</b>. No need to torrent anything. No need to extract anything. Just click the download link, double-click the icon, and the game is ready!</p>

<p><span class="important">"But developers won't sign up for this."</span> How can you say that? Our reputation is kinda low at the moment, sure. But that doesn't mean we can't improve it. <b>By communicating with original creators, we can convince them that we, as fan translators, can earn them more money in new markets.</b> We can do this! As long as we are committed, we can shape the industry the way we want it. There's absolutely no reason why there can't be a healthy relationship between developers and translators.</p>

<p><span class="important">"But people won't pay for something that they don't know they'll like."</span> That's a perfectly valid argument. But we can get around that. We can provide people with free trial versions of translated games. We can also provide them with visual novels that are free in the first place (<i>Narcissu 2</i>, <i>True Remembrance</i>, perhaps even <i>Katawa Shoujo</i>). If people like these, I'm sure they'd pay for more.</p>

<p><span class="important">"But people will still pirate these visual novels from elsewhere. People won't pay for a downloadable version."</span> I'm not trying to stop piracy. I'm merely trying to encourage more people to play visual novels legitimately. There's a clear difference. As for people not paying for a downloadable version… That's ridiculous. I myself have spent quite a lot of my money on downloadable visual novels (<i>Umineko</i>, MangaGamer releases, etc.). Sure, there will be people who won't pay for a downloadable version… But if we can get this going, maybe we can also get the rights to print physical versions. Maybe I'm thinking too far ahead, but I don't see why that can't be possible.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>I think that pretty much sums up how I feel about the matter. I'd just like to mention that despite my disapproval of Fuwanovel in its current form, I still consider Aaeru to be a friend. I'd like to thank her for supporting the industry, and for giving her opinions in a respectful manner. After all, there is no 'correct' opinion. I'd also like to thank her for supporting me in the past. Honestly, you're awesome, Aaeru! :-)</p>

<p>Well, then… I think I'll leave it at that. I'm not going to leave a comments box here, but if you have any opinions on the subject, please get in touch.</p>

<p>You can email me at <b>&lt;yirba3 (AT) gmail (DOT) com&gt;</b>. Alternatively, if you see me on the various IRC channels, please feel free to send me a message.</p>

<p>If there's anything else to address in future, I'll update this page. Until then, thanks for reading my ridiculously-oversized post.</p>

<p><b>My sole wish is that we can unite to bring the joy that is visual novels to the world…</b></p>
